This Pong Game Is Made in Python3 & Pygame Module.
Using NEAT (NEURO EVOLUTION AUGMENTED TOPOLOGIES) Algorithm.

This simple "tennis like" game features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first one to gain 10 point, a player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball. Its a two player game where 1st player uses keybord ` w ` and ` s ` And 2nd Player uses `UP Arrow keys` and `DOWN Arrow keys` to move the Paddle in Up & Down directions

I added comments throughout which hopefully makes it easier to understand 

Hope You Will Like The Game. also u can use the code to make your own version of game.
